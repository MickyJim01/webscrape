# Web Scraping Project #1

## Aim

> Login and navigate to the briefing page of NAIPS[^1]
> submit a briefing
> collect and decode the briefing into plain english

## Progress

So far, I have been able to login, submit and collect the page informatino, but i still need to create a function that separates the briefing into its separate parts:

-   Taf
-   Metar
-   ATIS

After doing that i still need to create a way to decode th information.
